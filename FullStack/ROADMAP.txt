PROJECT ROADMAP

PHASE 1: THE STACK (VERTICAL MAINTENANCE BAY) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Core Architecture (MVC Pattern).
[x] Logic: LIFO Stack with "Shuffle" algorithm.
[x] UI Overhaul: Integrated Rugged Handheld Interface.
[x] Feature: "Skip Animation" button for instant state synchronization.

PHASE 2: THE QUEUE (THE WEIGH STATION) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Logic: FIFO Queue with "Cycling" algorithm (Loopback).
[x] Logic Fix: Loopback trucks now correctly count towards Arrival/Departure stats.
[x] Visuals: High-Fidelity Industrial Yard with procedural props.
[x] Polish: Removed visual artifacts (skid marks) from road corners.

PHASE 3: LINKED LIST (THE CONVEYOR BELT) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Metaphor: Re-themed from "Convoy" to "Conveyor Belt" with boxes.
[x] Logic: Singly Linked List with Insert/Delete At Index.
[x] Visuals: High-detail warehouse with volumetric lighting.
[x] Interaction: Implemented intuitive "Click-to-Place" mouse interaction.

PHASE 4: TREES (THE ROUTING FLOOR) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Logic: Binary Search Tree insertion.
[x] Visuals: Top-down view of a sorting facility with diverter arms.
[x] Smart Layout: Implemented "Smooth Zoom" system.
    - Tree starts large and readable.
    - Automatically shrinks and repositions as depth increases.
    - 50% Fill Rate algorithm guarantees zero overlap at max depth.
[x] Animation: Packages travel along dynamic paths, following nodes as they resize.

PHASE 5: SORTING ALGORITHMS - [NEXT PRIORITY]
[ ] The Sorting Floor (Gantry Crane System).
    - Metaphor: A row of shipping containers.
    - Logic: Bubble Sort / Selection Sort.
    - Visuals: An overhead Gantry Crane that picks up and swaps containers.
    - Highlights: Color-coded comparisons (Red = Compare, Green = Sorted).
