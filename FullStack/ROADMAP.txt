PROJECT ROADMAP

PHASE 1: THE STACK (VERTICAL MAINTENANCE BAY) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Core Architecture (MVC Pattern).
[x] Logic: LIFO Stack with "Shuffle" algorithm.
[x] UI Overhaul: Integrated Rugged Handheld Interface.
[x] Feature: "Skip Animation" button for instant state synchronization.

PHASE 2: THE QUEUE (THE WEIGH STATION) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Logic: FIFO Queue with "Cycling" algorithm (Loopback).
[x] Logic Fix: Loopback trucks now correctly count towards Arrival/Departure stats.
[x] Visuals: High-Fidelity Industrial Yard with procedural props.
[x] Polish: Removed visual artifacts (skid marks) from road corners.
[x] Feature: "Skip Animation" button.

PHASE 3: LINKED LIST (THE CONVEYOR BELT) - [COMPLETED]
[x] Metaphor: Re-themed from "Convoy" to "Conveyor Belt" with boxes.
[x] Logic: Singly Linked List with Insert/Delete At Index.
[x] Visuals: High-detail warehouse with volumetric lighting.
[x] Interaction: Implemented intuitive "Click-to-Place" mouse interaction.
[x] Physics: Added satisfying drop-and-bounce animation for new boxes.

PHASE 4: TREES & SORTING - [NEXT PRIORITY]
[ ] Binary Search Tree (The Automated Routing Floor).
    - Visuals: Conveyor belts with diverter arms.
    - Logic: Recursive insertion and traversal.
[ ] Sorting Algorithms (The Sorting Floor).
    - Visuals: Gantry cranes moving containers.
    - Logic: Bubble Sort / Selection Sort visualization.
